* sync_folders

This program will sync folders on your local machine with one or more
target machines. 

** Design 

*** Phase 1

+ Program reads yaml file with description of which folders to sync
  and where to sync them to.

*** Phase 2

+ Make program deamonize, and write service file for it.  Follow
  model of ip_updater.

*** Phase 3

+ check computer activity to only run when there is little activity.
  Check CPU usage somehow.  Check network usage/disk usage.
